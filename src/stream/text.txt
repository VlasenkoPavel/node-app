early eighties. After a successful career in the Royal Australian Air Force during the
nineties, he returned to programming in the first decade of the twenty-first century.
He has found a new passion in developing responsive web applications using the
latest .NET technologies. He was force-fed TypeScript by Nathan Rozentals, and
now he wouldn't touch JavaScript without it. He believes there's a future for the Go
language and hacks at it in his spare time.
Remo H. Jansen is a web development engineer, open source contributor,
entrepreneur, technology lover, gamer, and Internet enthusiast. He is originally from
Seville, Spain, but he currently lives in Dublin, Ireland, where he has a full-time job
in the funds industry.
Remo has been working on large-scale JavaScript applications for the last few years,
from flight booking engines to investment and portfolio management solutions.
He loves exploring the possibilities of the Web, learning about new and exciting
technologies, and joining knowledge-sharing events such as meets, conferences,
and hackathons.
Remo has recently started working as an author on an upcoming book on TypeScript
by Packt Publishing.
